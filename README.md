# Entrainment_glasspatterns
ndividual alpha entrainment using glass patterns. Three groups (P match, T match and T mismatch) with EEG plus a fourth control group only behaviour. Analysing EEG and brain connectivity.

For connectivity calculations the Arfit toolbox to calculate the MVAR model is needed. You can find it here:  Tapio Schneider (2021). ARfit (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/174-arfit), MATLAB Central File Exchange.
